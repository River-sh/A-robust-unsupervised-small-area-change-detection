​     **A  robust small area change detection method was developed for multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar images, which includes several modules:  preprocessing, generating difference image, the analysis of difference image, sample enhancement and pixel classification. The detailed information can refer to our paper:  Robust Unsupervised Small Area Change Detection from SAR Imagery Using Deep Learning https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11005. **

​	**Here contains part of the core code of the developed method. Please cite our paper If it is helpful to you. We will update the news later. **
